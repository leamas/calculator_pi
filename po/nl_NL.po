"Calculator Plugin for OpenCPN by SaltyPaws aka Walbert Schulpen\n"
"=======================================\n"
"\n"
"This is a light weight yet powerful calculator plugin for OpenCPN. Would you "
"like to know your hull speed? \n"
"\n"
"Key features are:\n"
"* Storing results in variables\n"
"* Shows historic calculations\n"
"* Full complement of nautical functions\n"
"* Screen footprint can be optimised & minimised as required\n"
"\n"
"Adding formulas is easy. If your favorite nautical equation is missing, "
"please let me know your equation via flyspray, and I will add it.\n"
"\n"
